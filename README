- implemented a 'edit in local' function (when loaded, the file is locked - see PHILOSOPHY)
WARNING: NO UNDO
- implemented a 'run' function (to be tested a lot)
- implemented a 'save' function

TODO
- refresh the files list (to open a new version of modified file in editor)
- do not repeat the files already loaded (if not modified -internally, externally)
- Uhm, I do no remember :D

== DESCRIPTION:

shoe_ditor born from a (future) feature of shoe_vie.

shoe_vie was inspired from simple-video and simple-downloader samples to play with events and video.

A simple Shoes movie downloader, player, manager...

== PHILOSOPHY
Although provide a simple way to edit a file, shoe_ditor is not intended as a full in place editor.
It  provide a way to show multiple files, to take a glance. 
Then, is natural, a feature to open the file which must be hard edited in a external editor.

== FEATURES:

GUI usage

1) Click on File.

2) Choose a menu item:

3) "Open a file" open a ask_open_file dialog, select a file. It will opened directly in the edit_box.
3a) As an alternative, click on the "Open in editor" link to open the file in a external editor.

4) "Open a Dir" will display the files in the current directory, for example:
_________________________________________________________________
file number  | file name      | link to remove current file from list
1 -               | README        | -delete
2 -               | shoeditor.rb  | - delete
_________________________________________________________________

4a) Click in file name link, will open the file directly in the edit_box.
4b) Click in delete link, will remove the current file from list.
4c) As an alternative, click on the "Open in editor" link to open the file in a external editor.

== Known issues

This is a very simple app. Then:

1) Clicking two times in "Open a Dir", will display newly the files in current directory.
FIXME:
	- is_opened?
	- ask for directory to open

DONE:

2) Opening a very long list of files, display only a portion of files in the current directory.
FIXME:
	- change to a edit_box, maybe, or a better solution.
	
3) Do not save the file edited in shoe_ditor.
FIXME:
	- implement a simple "save" feature? Maybe...
